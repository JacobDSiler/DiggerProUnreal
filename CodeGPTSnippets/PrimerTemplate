üìù Voxel Terrain Editor ‚Äì Project Summary & Next Steps
Current State
Core System
Custom Voxel Terrain System for Unreal Engine 5, with real-time sculpting in a custom editor mode.
Brush Types Implemented: Sphere, Cube (now rotatable), Cylinder, Cone, Smooth, and Custom.
Brush Properties: Radius, Height/Length (for cone/cylinder), Rotation, Add/Subtract (dig/build), and (soon) Strength/Falloff.
Brushes use robust SDF-based logic for watertight, smooth marching cubes integration.
Smooth Brush: Blurs SDF in a region; in ‚Äúadd‚Äù mode, sharpens instead.
UI: Modular Slate toolkit with radio-style (and optionally button-style) brush/operation selectors, sliders for radius and height, and numeric entry boxes.
Recent Improvements
Watertightness: Transition zones for SDFs widened and smoothed, with optional post-brush smoothing for cone/cylinder.
Performance: Debug logs removed from voxel loops, resulting in much faster brush application.
Rotation: All brushes (except sphere) now support arbitrary rotation.
Height/Length: Cylinder and cone brushes now have a user-adjustable height property, with a max of 256, and the cone keeps its angle as height changes.
Island Detection: Efficient, robust flood-fill island detection implemented for the sparse voxel grid, with logging of island count and size.
Planned/Proposed Features
Marching Cubes Integration: Further tuning to ensure SDF conventions and surface extraction are robust, especially near terrain.
Island UI: ‚ÄúIslands‚Äù rollout in the editor panel, showing a grid of detected islands with per-island operations (Convert to Physics, Remove, Duplicate, Rotate, etc.).
Island Operations: Ability to select an island and perform actions, including real-time detection and UI updates in the editor.
Strength/Falloff: To be added for all brushes, allowing for more nuanced sculpting.
What‚Äôs Working Well
All brush types are functional, fast, and robust.
SDF transitions are smooth and watertight for marching cubes.
Smooth brush fixes holes and can sharpen when in ‚Äúadd‚Äù mode.
UI is modular and extensible, with all key brush properties adjustable.
Island detection is efficient and ready for UI integration.
Outstanding Issues / To-Do
Cone and Cylinder: Still benefit from a light smoothing pass after application for perfect watertightness.
Marching Cubes: Needs a review to ensure SDF=0 is always the surface, and that terrain integration is robust.
Island UI: Needs to be built in Slate, with a grid of icons, per-island selection, and operation buttons.
Island Operations: Implement logic for converting to physics, removing, duplicating, and rotating islands.
Strength/Falloff: Not yet implemented for brushes.
Custom Brush Preview: (Optional) Add visual feedback for custom mesh brushes.
Next Steps
Finalize Smoothing for Cone/Cylinder

Tune transition zone and optional post-brush smoothing for watertight marching cubes output.
Test and Polish Brush Height/Length

Ensure height slider/entry box works for cone/cylinder and updates in real time.
Test Brush Rotation

Confirm all brush types (except sphere) rotate as expected; check UI feedback.
Polish Smooth/Sharpen Brush

Tune smoothing/sharpening strength; consider auto-smooth after cone/cylinder.
Marching Cubes Integration

Review SDF conventions, ensure SDF=0 is the surface, and fix any edge cases or terrain blending issues.
Island UI/Operations

Complete the ‚ÄúIslands‚Äù rollout: grid of islands, per-island selection, operation buttons (Convert, Remove, Duplicate, Rotate).
Implement and test per-island actions and rotation controls.
Strength/Falloff

Add strength/falloff to brush SDF logic and UI, expose in toolkit.
Custom Brush Preview (Optional)

Add thumbnail or mesh preview for custom brushes in the UI.
Test All Features

Test all brush types and operations for edge cases and performance.
Gather feedback on UI/UX and iterate.
