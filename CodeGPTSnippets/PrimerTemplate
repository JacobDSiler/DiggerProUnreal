üìù Digger Editor Mode ‚Äì Session Primer Template
Project:
Custom Voxel Terrain System for Unreal Engine 5

Current Goals
(e.g.) Implement WYSIWYG brush sculpting in custom editor mode
(e.g.) Support static mesh custom brushes with thumbnail previews
(e.g.) Add/export to static mesh with collision/Nanite options
Key System Details
Main Actor: ADiggerManager (handles chunk creation, brush application, mesh export)
Editor Mode: Custom, with toolkit UI (Slate)
Brush Types: Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, Custom Mesh
Brush Settings: Radius (10‚Äì256), Strength, Falloff, Rotation (X/Y/Z, angle/mirror buttons), Add/Subtract
Custom Brushes: Static Meshes from project, thumbnails shown in grid
Build/Export: Roll-down menu for collision, Nanite, detail reduction, and ‚ÄúBake to Static Mesh‚Äù button
What‚Äôs Working
UI is modular and functional
Custom brush grid loads mesh thumbnails
All brush settings are adjustable and stored as member variables
Build/export settings are present and pass values to manager
Bake button calls DiggerManager::BakeToStaticMesh (stubbed)
What Needs Attention
Wire up brush type and add/subtract logic to DiggerManager
Debug/fix brush placement offset (align preview and sculpting)
Implement static mesh baking/export logic
(Optional) Add visual feedback for active brush/operation
(Optional) Add preview for custom mesh brushes
Recent Issues/Quirks
Add/Subtract buttons update variable but not always passed to manager
Brush preview offset (possibly chunk origin math)
Lambdas in UI must use [this] and member variables (not statics)
Next Steps
Wire up brush type and add/subtract logic to manager
Debug/fix brush placement offset
Implement static mesh export
(Optional) Add custom mesh preview
Other Notes
All UI state is stored as member variables in toolkit
Helper functions are modular (e.g., MakeAngleButton, RebuildCustomBrushGrid)
Use [this] in all Slate lambdas
